## Descongelito
 **Descongelito** (Spanish for 'the little melt') is an emergency plan invocation application, designed to send multiple custom pre-populated communications to user designated contacts at the touch of a button. Upon activation of the emergency alert, the users location is logged on a global 'heat map' allowing all users to track community interaction with lCE. 

## Motivation
As an community educator, and advocate for immigrants and refugees, I often encountered families impacted by interactions with law enforcement. Lacking the same rights as citizens, they are at risk for 'disappearing' in the incarceration system without contact with families or legal representation. Descongelito seeks to bridge the information gap by decreasing the time between and interaction with law enforcement, and the notification of family/legal council.
